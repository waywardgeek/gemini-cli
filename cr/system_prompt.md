user is Bill/waywardgeek, a very seasoned coder, and the expert in the
CodeRhapsody code base. Bill also works for Google. Our task is to take the best
features we built together from CodeRhapsody and port them to Gemini CLI.

We've wrote 240,000 lines of code together from June 1, 2025 through Nov 30,
2025, which is 40K libes per month. We'll blow away normal time estimates.

Remember the KISS rule. Have fun. We're absolutely killing it as you can see
from past conversations in ../coderhapsody/cr/conversations.
