Summary: Reverted buggy pause implementation and rebuilt from scratch with clear requirements.\n\n**Requirements Established**:\n- Pause triggers: typing or space during tool execution\n- Unpause conditions: Enter (send message), backspace to empty, space when empty\n- MUST: Chat window always visible and interactive when paused\n- Effect: Block tool execution, not streaming\n\n**Implementation**:\n1. Core: Added `isPaused` flag to CoreToolScheduler, blocks tool execution in attemptExecutionOfScheduledCalls\n2. UI State: Added isPaused state in useGeminiStream, new StreamingState.Paused\n3. Input Handlers: Auto-pause on text/space during execution, unpause on Enter/backspace/space-when-empty\n4. Visual: Yellow '⏸ PAUSED' indicator in LoadingIndicator with help text\n5. Props: Wired isPaused and setIsPaused through contexts (UIState, UIActions) to InputPrompt\n\n**Files Modified**: CoreToolScheduler, useReactToolScheduler, useGeminiStream, types.ts, InputPrompt, LoadingIndicator, Composer, AppContainer, UIStateContext, UIActionsContext, test files\n\n**Build**: Successful\n\n**Bug Found**: User tested and found that when paused, input prompt not visible (isInputActive didn't include StreamingState.Paused). Fixed by adding Paused to isInputActive condition.\n\n**Current Issue**: User reports can't enter text when paused - pressing space does nothing. Need to debug input handling.",

The PAUSED indicator is showing correctly, but input isn't working.\n\nIssue: In InputPrompt handleInput, when paused with empty buffer and user presses space, I unpause and return (preventing space from being added). Then if they type more, auto-pause triggers again. Need to check why typing isn't working when paused.\n\nHypothesis: The pause/unpause logic in handleInput might be interfering with normal text input flow. Need to verify the code path when paused and user types regular characters.",
